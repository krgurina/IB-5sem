THIS LABORATORY WORK IS DEVOTED TO THE ANALYSIS OF ONE OF THE CASES OF PRACTICAL CRYPTOGRAPHY. IN THIS REGARD, IT WILL BE
APPROPRIATE HERE TO CHARACTERIZE THE OPPOSITE OF CRYPTOGRAPHY – CRYPTANALYSIS. THIS TERM WAS INTRODUCED BY AN AMERICAN CRYPTOGRAPHER
BY WILLIAM F. FRIEDMAN IN LET US RECALL ONCE AGAIN THAT CRYPTANALYSIS IS A BRANCH OF CRYPTOGRAPHY DEALING WITH METHODS OF CRACKING CIPHERS OR METHODS OF ORGANIZING CRYPTOGRAPHIC ATTACKS ON CIPHERS. 
LET'S BRIEFLY ANALYZE THE MAIN CRYPTO ATTACKS.
AN ATTACK WITH A KNOWN CIPHERTEXT (CIPHERTEXT ONLY ATTACK). 
IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE ENEMY KNOWS THE ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM, HE
HAS A SET OF INTERCEPTED CRYPTOGRAMS, BUT HE DOES NOT KNOW THE SECRET KEY. 
TYPES OF SUCH AN ATTACK: FULL KEY SEARCH (FRONTAL ATTACK, BRUTEFORCE ATTACK); DICTIONARY ATTACK, DICTIONARY KEY SEARCH (DICTIONARY 
ATTACK); IT IS OFTEN USED TO CRACK PASSWORDS; FREQUENCY CRYPTANALYSIS IS A METHOD OF BREAKING A CIPHER BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS A DEPENDENCE BETWEEN
FREQUENCIES.
